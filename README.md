# Alfred-workflow-cleanshot
A simple CleanShot workflow using the CleanShot X URL scheme

# Requirement

This workflow requires that you have [CleanShot X for Mac](https://cleanshot.com/) 4.4 or later installed. It uses the CleanShot X URL scheme API to send commands to CleanShot X.


# Usage

Run the workflow by typing the default keyword followed by /<space/> for a list of the various CleanShot X utilities you can trigger from the workflow.

You can also type your default keyword *without* following it by /<space/> to launch or quit CleanShot (i.e., that is a toggle).
