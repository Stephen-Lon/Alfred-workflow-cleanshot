# Alfred-workflow-cleanshot
A simple CleanShot workflow using the CleanShot X URL scheme

# Requirement

This workflow requires that you have [CleanShot X for Mac](https://cleanshot.com/) 4.4 or later installed. It uses the CleanShot X URL scheme API to send commands to CleanShot X.

Please note that version 1.4 (and later) of the workflow requires Alfred 5.5 (and later). If you are using an older version of Alfred please use [version 1.3](https://github.com/Stephen-Lon/Alfred-workflow-cleanshot/releases/tag/v1.3) of this workflow.

# Usage

Run the workflow by typing the default keyword for a list of the various CleanShot X utilities you can trigger from the workflow. You can search the list by pressing <kbd>space</kbd> and typing the first few letters of the utility you need.

Note that there is also a default keyword for quitting CleanShot Xâ€”in case you do not wish to leave it running once you have used it.

From version 1.4 of the workflow Alfred learns from used items to bring them to the top of the list.
